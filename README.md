# duklog

duklog is a simple _offline_ logging tool for ham radio.

I was unhappy with existing solutions for logging in the field on linux.
Existing loggers have too many features and too much reliance on the internet.
I just wanted the ability to create a log, enter a few pieces of info, and start logging QSOs in a simple, lightweight, offline environment.

duklog provides this via a lightweigth TUI that runs in the terminal and allows exporting an ADIF file for uploading to my main logs, the POTA site, etc.

duklog is written in rust so the standard `cargo` commands apply.
